💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection (Advanced)📌 OverviewThis project builds an advanced machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using real-world transaction data.🧠 ProblemThe dataset is highly imbalanced (very few fraud cases). A simple accuracy-based model would fail to detect fraud effectively.⚙️ ApproachData preprocessing & feature engineeringEncoding categorical variablesSMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) to balance classesXGBoost classifier for high-performance predictionEvaluation using Precision, Recall, F1-score & Confusion Matrix📊 ResultsAccuracy: ~99%Fraud Recall: ~84%Successfully detects majority of fraudulent transactions💾 Model DeploymentThe trained model is saved using Joblib (`.pkl` file) for future reuse without retraining.🛠 Tech StackPython, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE), XGBoost---👨‍💻 Rahul Ingle  CODSOFT Machine Learning Internship
